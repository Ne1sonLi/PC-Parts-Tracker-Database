### Project Summary

Our project is about modeling PC components to allow users to understand how different parts of a PC work together and what is required to create your own PC. Using this database, users will be able to look up the price of different PC parts and customize their own PC. The final build of the PC will indicate whether all the parts are compatible with each other as well as the final price of the PC.
