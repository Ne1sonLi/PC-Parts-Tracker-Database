### Project Summary

Our project is about modeling PC components to allow users to understand how different parts of a PC work together and what is required to create your own PC. Using this database, users will be able to look up the price of different PC parts and customize their own PC. The final build of the PC will indicate whether all the parts are compatible with each other as well as the final price of the PC.

### Changes in Schema

We had to remove the table Mouse_Brand because orcale only allowed us to have a maximum of 30 tables. If we included Mouse_Brand, we would have 31 tables which would exceed the space quota we are given to work with in Oracle. We chose to remove this table as it seemed to be a little trivial and we assumed it would not affect the final project much.
